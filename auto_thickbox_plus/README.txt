INTRODUCTION
------------
Thickbox has been out of development for a number of years. Its latest version
has problems in some browsers, particularly Internet Explorer. This module
replaces Thickbox with a fork called Auto ThickBox Plus, which is a drop-in
replacement for the original ibrary but improves browser support.


INSTALLATION
------------
Enable this module and the Thickbox module.
